   title: 'Star Basics',
   content: 'Astronomers estimate that the universe could contain up to one septillion stars – that’s a one followed by 24 zeros. Our Milky Way alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the Sun.Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages.',
   

   paragraph: 'Stars are incredibly important for our understanding of the universe. They provide us with insights into the early stages of the universe, the distribution of matter in the universe, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. The study of stars has led to the discovery of new elements, such as iron and carbon, and has also provided insights into the birth and death of stars. Stars also play a crucial role in the formation of galaxies, which are large.',
   
   
   paragraph: 'groups of stars, known as galaxies. Stars also contribute to the formation of galaxies by nuclear fusion, which releases energy in the form of light, heat, and electromagnetic radiation. Nuclear fusion occurs when atomic nuclei combine to form a new element, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. Galaxies are made up of billions of stars, each with its own unique properties and life cycles. The study of galaxies has led to the discovery of new types.Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. Molecular clouds range from 1,000 to 10 million times the mass of the Sun and can span as much as hundreds of light-years. Molecular clouds are cold which causes gas to clump, creating high-density pockets. Some of these clumps can collide with each other or collect more matter, strengthening their gravitational force as their mass grows. Eventually, gravity causes some of these clumps to collapse. When this happens, friction causes the material to heat up, which eventually leads to the development of a protostar – a baby star. Batches of stars that have recently formed from molecular clouds are often called stellar clusters, and molecular clouds full of stellar clusters are called stellar nurseries.',
   
   
   paragraph: 'At first, most of the protostar’s energy comes from heat released by its initial collapse. After millions of years, immense pressures and temperatures in the star’s core squeeze the nuclei of hydrogen atoms together to form helium, a process called nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion releases energy, which heats the star and prevents it from further collapsing under the force of gravity.',

  title: 'SpaceX Successfully Launches First Crewed Dragon Mission',
  content: 'In a thrilling moment, SpaceX successfully launched its first crewed Dragon mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft, named Dragon 1, is now in orbit around the Earth. Dragon 1 has been designed to carry humans for up to 90 days, providing a long-term mission on three different vehicles: the shuttle, Soyuz and Crew Dragon. The mission is the first crewed orbital flight licensed commercially by the Federal Aviation Administration.',
  
  paragraph: 'The mission is also the first operational commercial crew flight, after the successful completion of the Demo-2 test flight this summer with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board. NASA signed the paperwork formally certifying the spacecraft at the end of a flight readiness review Nov. 10.',
  
  paragraph:'“It’s just a tremendous day that is a culmination of a ton of work,” Lueders said at a Nov. 10 briefing after the review. “It’s NASA saying to SpaceX you have shown us you can deliver a crew transportation capability that meets our requirements.”',
  
  paragraph: 'The certification also formally closed out SpaceX’s commercial crew contract with NASA to develop and demonstrate the Crew Dragon spacecraft. “With this milestone, NASA has concluded that the SpaceX system has successfully met our design, safety and performance requirements,” said Phil McAlister, director of commercial spaceflight development at NASA Headquarters, during a Nov. 12 call with reporters. “It marks the end of the development phase of the system.”',
